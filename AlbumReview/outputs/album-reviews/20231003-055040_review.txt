Review of Kid Cudi's "Indicud": A muddled mess of half-baked ideas and self-indulgence. Cudi's state of mind is chaotic, reflected in the scattered tracks and inconsistent production. Weak lyrics and repetitive themes drag it down, despite a few glimpses of his musical talent. Best consumed alone, in a dark room while high, where the confusion might seem profound. Only die-hard stans seeking to wallow in nostalgia will find value; everyone else should steer clear. #Indi-suck
