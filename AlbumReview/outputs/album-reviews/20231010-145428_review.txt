Ah, Frank Ocean's new album "blonde" they do say,
A conceptual masterpiece in its own wistful way.
Its dactylic hexameter, so refined and profound,
But flaws? A plenty and never a gimmick to self confound.

Though lyrical prowess is easy to find,
The melodies lack depth, just fluttering through the mind.
Frank's state of mind seems scattered, unheard cries and pleas,
While parts feel raw and pure, we wish for more cohesion with ease.

On production did they spare no expense,
As sounds drift across spectrum with innovative recompense.
Collaborations aplenty, some fit seamlessly within the art,
While others feel forced and fail to truly impart.

Culturally speaking it succeeds amidst praise high above
With its portrayals of love blurred by gender divide so tough.
in introspective essence though it lacks pounding beats
Found in happier places where consumption rarely sweet

For a heartache too deep or searching souls awake at dawn 
This enigmatic creation finds an apt canvas drawn.
But those seeking quick tunes will surely be led astray,
As this piece demands attention its power won't betray.
