Frank Ocean's blonde is a glitchy, avant-garde masterpiece. Weakness: excessive autotune. Strength: raw vulnerability. Assumption: Frank in existential crisis mode. Production and collabs are top-notch; cultural value sky high! Best consumed alone in a dark room or at an underground warehouse rave. Ideal listener: introspective millennials seeking sonic exploration and emotional catharsis.
