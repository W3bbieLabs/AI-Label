"channel orange exposes Frank Ocean's mind-numbingly pretentious musings. Weak lyrics and generic beats overpower any inkling of substance, revealing self-indulgence at its worst. Lackluster production & baffling themes make this album irrelevant in  terms of cultural value. Only masochistic listeners would endure this drivel in a dark basement surrounded by scented candles."
